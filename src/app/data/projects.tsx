            planning and prototyping all application screens, but also in
            implementing the required changes directly in code
          </strong>
          . This has been a huge project, so many times we needed to do the
          changes from the design department.

          My responsibilities also included defining the new design system

          In addition,I collaborated closely with data engineers, product
