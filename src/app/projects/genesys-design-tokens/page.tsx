        <ArticleParagraph>
          Once the design system was launched, one thing became immediately
          clear: our designs looked great in Figma, but translating them into
          code was messy. Colors, typography, and spacing were implemented
          differently across platforms, which slowed development and caused
          frequent mismatches.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          To solve this, I decided to{" "}
          <strong>build a design token library</strong> with the invaluable help
          of a highly enthusiastic frontend developer. Using a structured JSON
          as the foundation, the idea was simple: define all visual styles once
          and let automation handle the rest. With Style Dictionary, we
          generated CSS, SASS, JS, and even Figma variables directly from a
          single source — ensuring our brand looked consistent everywhere.

      {/* CHALLENGE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- */}
      <ArticleSection heading="The Challenge">
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Before the tokens library, any design outside the UI components
          library — which was already integrated with tokens — required
          developers to manually copy values and translate them into code.
          Naturally, this introduced small inconsistencies along the way. It was{" "}
          <strong>time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating</strong> for
          everyone involved.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          I realized we needed a <strong>single source of truth</strong> — not
          just a document, but a living system where any change would ripple
          across every platform automatically. The challenge was balancing
          flexibility for designers with reliability for developers, creating a
          system that worked seamlessly across design tools and codebases.

        <ArticleParagraph>
          We built a living <strong>documentation site in Storybook</strong>,
          where every design token was neatly organized, previewed, and
          explained. It included an advanced searchable table allowing
          developers to filter by format, tier, category, or scheme — and
          whenever possible, each token previewed its actual appearance.

      {/* DEVELOPMENT APPROACH ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- */}
      <ArticleSection heading="Development Approach">
        <ArticleParagraph>
          The first step was{" "}
          <strong>defining the structure of our tokens</strong> in JSON. I
          grouped them into categories like color, typography, spacing, and
          elevation — thinking about both global and component-level scopes. The
          goal was clarity: anyone on the team should understand and use the
          tokens without confusion.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Semantics and naming conventions were crucial for usability. We
          defined three token tiers — <strong>global</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>alias</strong>, and <strong>component</strong>:
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleList>
          <li>
            <strong>Global</strong>: the raw value without semantic meaning:{" "}
            <code className="text-lg">global-color-palette-ui-error-03</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alias</strong>: global values reused with semantic naming,
            not tied to a specific component:{" "}
            <code className="text-lg">
              alias-color-background-feedback-error-strong
            </code>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Component</strong>: alias values reused and renamed for a
            specific component context:{" "}
            <code className="text-lg">
              cmp-button-color-background-error-disabled
            </code>
            .
          </li>
        </ArticleList>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Then came <strong>automation</strong>. Using Style Dictionary, we
          transformed the JSON source into multiple formats: CSS custom
          properties, SASS variables, JS constants, and Figma variables. Updates
          became effortless — changing a single value automatically propagated
          across platforms, saving time for both designers and developers.
