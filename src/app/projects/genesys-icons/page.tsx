          The library was created to{" "}
          <strong>streamline and standardize iconography</strong>
          across product and engineering teams, providing a unified, reusable
          set of SVG and font-based icons, as well as React components built in
          TypeScript.

          This initiative was part of a broader effort to strengthen the design
          system's foundations — ensuring that visual language, accessibility,
          and implementation were coherent across platforms. The result was a
          <strong>versatile icon library</strong> capable of evolving alongside
          the company's design language and development needs.

      <ArticleSection heading="The Challenge">
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Before this project,{" "}
          <strong>icon usage was fragmented and inconsistent</strong>. Multiple
          teams used different icon sets, naming conventions, and formats,
          causing visual clutter, confusion, and duplication. This also slowed
          development, as engineers often had to import or recreate assets
          manually.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          The main challenge was to design a system that would{" "}
          <strong>centralize all icons while maintaining flexibility</strong>.
          It needed to work across technologies, support accessibility, and
          scale easily while remaining maintainable by designers and developers.

        <ArticleParagraph>
          Designers can easily add new icons by{" "}
          <strong>uploading SVG files</strong>, while an automated script
          handles conversion into React components.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          We built a living <strong>documentation site in Storybook</strong>,
          where each icon is organized, previewed, and explained. It includes a
          gallery with advanced search based on SVG attributes like title and
          description.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          This process reduced handoff friction and ensured designers and
          developers remained aligned, always working with{" "}
          <strong>the same up-to-date assets</strong>.

        <ArticleParagraph>
          The library was built entirely in React and TypeScript for type safety
          and scalability. Each icon component is lightweight, reusable, and
          performance-optimized, letting developers import only what is needed.
          This keeps <strong>bundle sizes low</strong> while maintaining
          flexibility.
