        <ArticleParagraph>
          The original platform had evolved through years of incremental
          development, resulting in a fragmented experience. Data tables,
          dashboards, and charts were built inconsistently by different teams,
          using separate codebases and styling approaches. This led to{" "}
          <strong>
            visual clutter, reduced usability, and high maintenance costs
          </strong>
          .
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          The main challenge was to unify this ecosystem under a single{" "}
          <strong>scalable design system</strong> that would preserve analytical
          power while improving clarity and performance.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          The redesign also needed to support <strong>new use cases</strong>,
          such as more customizable dashboards, new data tables based in
          components library, new navigation architecture and main menu,
          advanced data filtering... etc. without adding cognitive overload.

          We started with a <strong>full product audit</strong>, mapping all
          pages, widgets, and interactive elements used across different modules
          of the platform. We ran interviews with data analysts, business users,
          and internal developers to identify pain points in the workflow. The
          biggest issues were related to discoverability (hidden features),
          visual overload, and lack of standardization in visualizations.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          In parallel, we <strong>benchmarked leading analytics tools</strong>{" "}
          to understand best practices in handling dense data interfaces. The
          key insight was that consistency and clarity were far more valuable
          than visual novelty. These findings guided our decision to build a
          flexible system around composable, data-first components.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          In addition, we used a{" "}
          <strong>previous comprehensive research</strong> from my own design

          The <strong>new design system</strong>, internally named "Genesys",
          was conceived as a modular ecosystem covering UI components, data
          visualizations, and interaction patterns. We defined design tokens for
          color, typography, spacing, and data states, ensuring visual harmony
          across tables, charts, and dashboards.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          To ensure adoption, we created Figma libraries linked to a Storybook
          instance used by developers.{" "}
          <strong>Each component was documented</strong> with accessibility
          notes, responsive behavior rules, and usage examples. This
          dramatically reduced design-developer handoff time and standardized
          visual consistency across teams.

          We <strong>simplified the interface</strong> by introducing a clean,

          One major learning was the importance of{" "}
          <strong>designing for flexibility within constraints</strong>. In
          data-heavy environments, small inconsistencies can lead to confusion
          or misinterpretation, so maintaining strict system governance became
          essential. Another takeaway was that early developer involvement
          accelerates adoption and ensures scalability.

          Moving forward, we plan to extend Genesys to support{" "}
          <strong>
            dark mode, advanced data visualizations (e.g., network graphs,
            maps), and responsive layouts
          </strong>{" "}
          for secondary devices. The system will also evolve into a shared
          design infrastructure for all internal analytics tools, unifying
          visual language company-wide.
