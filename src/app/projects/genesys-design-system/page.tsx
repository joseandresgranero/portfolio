        <ArticleParagraph>
          Before the design system existed, the product ecosystem faced major
          inconsistencies ‚Äî not only visual, but also in how users interacted
          with the platform. The same actions could be performed in multiple
          ways, using different components depending on where the user was in
          the product.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Meanwhile, developers were building their own components and layouts
          for every new feature or enhancement, which significantly increased
          both development time and maintenance costs.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          To make things even more complex, the Professional Services team was
          continuously creating new, tailor-made vertical applications for
          specific clients.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          As a result, maintaining visual consistency, accessibility standards,
          and scalability across products had become almost impossible.
        </ArticleParagraph>{" "}
        <ArticleParagraph>
          That‚Äôs when we decided to create a unified design system ‚Äî not just as
          a visual framework, but as a strategic foundation to transform how
          Devo designed and built its products.
