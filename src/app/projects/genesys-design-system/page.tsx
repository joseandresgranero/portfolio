      <ArticleSection heading="The Challenge">
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Before the design system existed, the product ecosystem faced{" "}
          <strong>major inconsistencies</strong> — not only visual, but also in
          how users interacted with the platform. Users could perform the same
          action in different ways depending on the section, leading to
          confusion and usability issues.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Meanwhile, developers were building their own components and layouts
          for every new feature or enhancement, which significantly increased
          both development time and <strong>maintenance costs</strong>.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          Additionally, the Professional Services team was constantly building
          custom vertical apps for clients, further fragmenting the visual and
          technical ecosystem.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          As a result, maintaining visual consistency, accessibility standards,
          and scalability across products had become almost impossible.
        </ArticleParagraph>
        <ArticleParagraph>
          This challenge led us to create a unified Design System — not just as
          a visual framework but as a <strong>strategic foundation</strong> to
          transform how Devo designed and built its products.

          This <strong>benchmarking</strong> helped us refine the structure of

          and scalability.

        <ArticleParagraph>
          We also kept <strong>close communication with developers</strong> to
          understand their needs and technical constraints, and within the
          design team to align on workflows and daily challenges. This ensured
          the system truly served both teams, with a special focus on developers

          Finally,{" "}
          <strong>I conducted a thorough audit of the existing UI</strong> to
          identify visual and interaction inconsistencies. We inventoried
          existing components, removed duplicates, and spotted gaps, which

          Each component went through <strong>several design iterations</strong>{" "}
          and feedback rounds with designers and developers. We refined
          behaviors, variants, and states to make them more intuitive and
          accessible. This process helped us simplify the system and make it
          feel cohesive at every level.
